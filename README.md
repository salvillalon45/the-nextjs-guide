## The Next.js Pages Router Guide

## Intro

I created this repo to learn more about NextJS. I use it at work, but I want to take a step further and understand more on the features of Next.js using the Pages Router. I also create an article that explains what is Pre-Rendering and Hydration to follow along with the concepts covered in this tutorial.

## Getting Started

In the GitHub repo you can find the code snippets for:

-   A page implementing getStaticProps and getStaticPaths

-   A page implementing getStaticProps

-   A page implementing getServerSideProps with Client Side fetching

-   A page to demonstrate Hydration Errors

-   Using the API directory to implement our own API routes

To run the application

-   Clone the repo
-   do `npm install`
-   do `npm run dev`
