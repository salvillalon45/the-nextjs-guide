## The Nextjs Guide

## Intro

I created this repo to learn more about NextJS. I use it at work, but I want to take a step further and understand more on the features of NextJS.

This repo uses the NextJS Pages Router. Then there will be another repo with my notes on App Router

## Getting Started

There is a documenation directory. In there contains my finding and notes on how NextJs works

To run the sample application do `npm run dev`
