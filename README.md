## The Next.js Pages Router Guide

## Intro

I created this repo to learn more about NextJS. I use it at work, but I want to take a step further and understand more on the features of NextJS using the Pages Router.

This repo uses the NextJS Pages Router. Then there will be another repo with my notes on App Router

## Getting Started

There is a documenation directory. In there contains my finding and notes on how NextJs works

I created the following Routes:

-   client-side-fetching: Explains how client fetching is done and how it compares to static-side and server-side
-   server-side-rendering: Explains how Server Side Rendering is done and how data can be loaded
-   static-site-generation: Explains how Static Site Generation is done and how data can be loaded
-   intro: Brief intro to Next.js in my own words

To run the application

-   Clone the repo
-   do `npm install`
-   do `npm run dev`
